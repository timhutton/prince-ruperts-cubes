Below are three unit cubes centered at the origin. The red one doesn't move. It is drilled by a square hole of unit size at a random angle and has a blue cube inserted into the hole.
<p>
When the red cube is still a single connected piece after drilling this is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert%27s_cube">Prince Rupert's cube</a>.
<p>
The blue cube is drilled by another square hole at a random angle and has a green cube inserted into the hole.
<p>
The magenta mesh is the intersection between the remaining parts of the red cube and the green cube. Only if the magenta mesh is empty is it possible to fit the three cubes inside each other.
<p>
Keys:
<ul><li>space : start/stop the changing of the angles
<li>r : toggle the red cube between wireframe and solid
<li>b : toggle the blue cube between wireframe and solid
<li>g : toggle the green cube between wireframe and solid
<li>m : toggle the magenta mesh between wireframe and solid
</ul>
Use the mouse to rotate the scene and zoom in/out.
